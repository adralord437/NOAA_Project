In this repository i will be developing the analyses that correspond to the Final course assignment of the Jonh Hopkins University Reproducible Research Course

This particular assignments goal is to answer two questions:
1 - Across the United States, which types of events (as indicated in the \color{red}{\verb|EVTYPE|}EVTYPE variable) are most harmful with respect to population health?
2 - Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?

In order to answer this questions in a professional way im gonna do a report using R-Markdown and then I will publish this report in Rpub Website
